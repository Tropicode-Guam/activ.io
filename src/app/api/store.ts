        "desc": "Nestled in Guam’s capital city of Hagatna is a place where island residents and visitors gather for mouth-watering local and international cuisine, arts and crafts and novelty gifts.\n\nThe Chamorro Village is open every day of the week but is best known for its Wednesday Night Market. It is not uncommon to notice the smell of barbecue as you walk through Spanish influenced buildings that lead you to a center court where people of all ages dance the night away. You can also find farmers displaying local produce grown under their care and local dance groups entertaining the crowd. Fresh fruit juices are usually available to quench your thirst after a long, hot day. In addition, carabao rides and other cultural activities are simply a few steps away. The Chamorro Village is also ideally located near the Hagatna Marina, Paseo de Susanna and across the street from Skinner Plaza and the Guam Museum.\n\nWith a mission to maintain a place that encourages and promotes made on Guam products and small businesses, the Chamorro Village is the perfect place for visitors to experience being part of the island’s extended family. It is also a hub for the local community that perpetuates Guam’s culture and traditions."
